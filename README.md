# GiftList
GiftList is an application that allows users to donate items and search for items that are being donated. Users can sign up
or log in to manage their account and/or list items. Items for donation are listed with a title, description and optional 
photo. 

The desire behind this application was to provide the market with an application much like CraigsList, but dedicated solely
to users who wished to donate or give items away.
